1.1  I heard about many GUI for WeeChat. How can I compile/use them?

  Curses GUI is built by default.
  To build Gtk or Qt GUI you've to specify extra options to ./configure script:
    --enable-gtk to enable gtk GUI
    --enable-qt  to enable Qt QUI
  Type ./configure --help to see available options.
  WARNING: only Curses GUI is ok today. Other GUI are under development!


1.2  I can't compile WeeChat CVS.

  Check that you have latest version of autoconf and automake.
  WeeChat has been developed with autoconf version 2.56 and automake version 1.7.
  You should have at least these versions in order to compile WeeChat CVS.
  If you can't or don't want to install these versions, you can download and
  install "devel package", a package built almost every day, based on CVS.
  Note that this package may not correspond exactly to CVS base.

2.1  Why using WeeChat ? X-Chat and Irssi are so good...

  Because WeeChat is very light and has new features.
  Some new features:
    * many GUI (Curses, Gtk, Qt),
    * extensible with scripts (Perl, Python, Ruby),
    * developed from scratch (not based on any other IRC client)
    * multi-platform
    * 100% GPL and free
  This is the "geekest Irc client" ;)


2.2  I've launched WeeChat, but I'm lost, what can I do?

  For help you can type /help. For help about a command, type /help command.


2.3  How can I customize key bindings?

  Today you can't do that. This will be available in a future version.


2.4  How can I load Perl scripts?
     Are Perl scripts compatible with X-chat or/and Irssi ?

  Yes, you can use /perl command to launch scripts
  (default path is ~/.weechat/perl).
  Note that scripts in ~/.weechat/perl/autoload are automatically loaded
  when WeeChat is starting up.
  WeeChat perl scripts are compatible with X-Chat, not with Irssi, sorry ;)


2.5  How can I load Python scripts?

  Today Python interface is not developed, so can't load any Python script.


2.6  How can I load Ruby scripts?

  Today Ruby interface is not developed, so can't load any Ruby script.

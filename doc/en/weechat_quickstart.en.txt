WeeChat quick start guide (english version)
=========================

1. Launch weechat

     According to choosed GUI, you have to launch:
     - weechat-curses for Curses GUI
     - weechat-gtk for Gtk GUI (under development)
     - weechat-qt for Qt GUI (not developed)
     - weechat-wxwidgets for WxWidgets GUI (not developed)

2. Online help / options

     WeeChat has help for all commands, just issue /help
     To get help on a command, issue /help command

     To set options, use /set option = value
     You can use /set option with partial name (display all options
     containg letters), or with only a full option name without value
     (to see long help for option).

     Important note: settings are saved when WeeChat ends (or with "/save"
     command). Do NOT edit setup file while WeeChat is running, because WeeChat
     may write this file at any time, and it's not possible to reload it.
     To change any settings, use "/set" command, WeeChat immediately uses new
     settings.

3. Create a server

     For example irc.quakenet.org, port 6667:
       /server add quakenet irc.quakenet.org 6667
     (/help server for full command help)

4. Set custom server options
   
     Nicks:
       /set quakenet.server_nick1 = "mynick"
       /set quakenet.server_nick2 = "mynick2"
       /set quakenet.server_nick3 = "mynick3"

     Username/realname:
       /set quakenet.server_username = "My username"
       /set quakenet.server_realname = "My real name"

     Auto-connect to server:
       /set quakenet.server_autoconnect = on

     Auto-join for some channels:
       /set quakenet.server_autojoin = "#chan1,#chan2"

     Other options:
       You can see servers options and values with /set quakenet
       To set an option, use /set quakenet.server_option = value

5. Connect to server and auto-join channels:

     /connect quakenet

6. Join/part channels

     Join a channel:
       /join #channel
     Part a channel:
       /part [quit message]
     Part a channel and close buffer:
       /close [quit message]
     (/close is an alias on /buffer close)

7. Buffer/window management

     You can manage buffers with "/buffer" command and windows
     with "/window" command.
     For example, to split verticaly screen into a small window (1/3 width),
     and a large (2/3), use command:
       /window splitv 33

8. Key bindings

     According to your keyboard and/or your needs, you can rebind any key
     with "/key" command.
     A useful key is meta-k (alt-k) to find key codes.

     For example, to bind meta-y (alt-y) to command "/buffer close":
       /key (press meta-k) (press meta-y) /buffer close
     You'll have a command line like:
       /key meta-y /buffer close

9. Plugins/scripts

     On some distros like Debian, plugins are available via a separate package
     (like weechat-plugins).
     Plugins are automatically loaded when found.
     Many plugins/scripts are available for WeeChat, please look at:
       http://weechat.flashtux.org/plugins.php
     Please look at WeeChat documentation to load/unload plugins or scripts.

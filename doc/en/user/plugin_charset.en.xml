  <title>Charset plugin</title>
  
  <para>
    Charset plugin lets you encode or decode data using charsets, with 3
    levels: global, by server, or by channel.
    This plugin is optional, but recommended: if it's not loaded, WeeChat
    can only read/write UTF-8 data.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Charset plugin should be autoloaded by WeeChat at startup.
    To be sure plugin is loaded, try:
    "<literal>/charset</literal>".
    If command is not found, then load plugin with command:
    <screen>/plugin load charset</screen>
    If plugin is not found, then you should compile again WeeChat with
    plugins and Charset support.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    When Charset plugin starts, it displays terminal and internal charsets.
    Terminal charset depends on your locale, and internal is UTF-8.
    For example :
<screen>
-P- Charset plugin starting, terminal charset: ISO-8859-15 (WeeChat internal: UTF-8)
</screen>
  </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          To set global decode and encode charsets, use
          "<literal>/setp</literal>" command.
          For example:
<screen>
/setp charset.global.decode = ISO-8859-15
/setp charset.global.encode = ISO-8859-15
</screen>
          If global decode charset is not set (for example during first
          load of Charset plugin), it will be automatically set to terminal
          charset (if it's different from UTF-8), or by default to
          "<literal>ISO-8859-1</literal>".
          Default encode value is empty, so it sends by default with
          internal charset (UTF-8).
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          To set server charset, use "<literal>/charset</literal>" command
          on server buffer.
          If you give only charset, then it will set "decode" and "encode"
          values.
          For example:
          <screen>/charset ISO-8859-15</screen>
          It's equivalent to:
<screen>
/charset decode ISO-8859-15
/charset encode ISO-8859-15
</screen>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          To set channel (or private) charset, use same commands as server,
          but on channel (or private) buffer.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      If you have problems with chars or accents using Charset plugin:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            check that weechat-curses is linked to libncursesw (warning:
            needed on most distributions but not all) :
            <screen>ldd /path/to/weechat-curses</screen>
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            check charset line (on server buffer), you should see
            ISO-XXXXXX or UTF-8 for terminal charset. If you see
            ANSI_X3.4-1968 or other values, probably your locale is wrong.

          <para>
            setup global decode value, for example:

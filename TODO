    - Windows version
    + Solaris version

    # "/mode" command: change the user/channels modes
    + "/dcc" command (for chat and sending/receiving files)
    # "/query" command: start private conversation

 * Interface:
    + internationalization (traduce WeeChat in many languages)
    # display current channel modes (example : #weechat(+nt))

    - add key bindings to config file


Future versions:
---------------

 * General:
    - *BSD version

 * IRC protocol:
    - complete "/list" command: add regexp search, display only channels that
      match regexp
    - "/ignore" and "/unignore" commands: hide all that is write by a given
      nick/host
    - when we're away, WeeChat should log all the lines begenning by our nick.
      When we come back from our away it should print it to the current window
    - "/notify" and "/unnotify" command to be warn by WeeChat when a given
      nick/host connect to the given irc network

 * WeeChat commands:
    - "/reload" command: reload the WeeChat's config file
    - "/highlight" command: highlight a given word when it appears on
      channels/privates
    - "/completion" command: do shortcuts (for example when we type "u"
      in the text bar it send it to the server as "you")
    - "/exec" command: execute a command as if we was in shell
      and show us the output on the current window. An option to exec
      like -o could send the output to the server, on the current
      channel/private
    - "/last": command to look for text in previous messages

 * Interface:
    + Gtk GUI
    - color for nicks (except own nick) when nick colors are disabled
    - interpret special chars in messages (color & bold for example)
    - many channel windows in one window/term (window split)
    - add lag indicator
    - forget some old lines that were displayed long time ago (now all is saved,
      if WeeChat is running for long time, a lot of memory is used!)
    - improve completion (for example complete command parameters when possible)
    - understand incomplete commands if unambigous (for example: /he for /help is ok)
    - tab key with empty command line should switch to next window (like F7)
    - log chats to file
    ? Qt GUI

 * TCP/IP communication:
    - connect to server with child process (background)
    - proxy support
    - SSL support
    - IPv6 protocol implementation

 * Configuration:
    - load config file after GUI (so init values by default (colors, ...) before
      loading config)

 * Plugins:
    - Python plugin
    - "/python load" and "/python unload" commands to (un)load Python scripts
    - Ruby plugin
    - "/ruby load" and "/ruby unload" commands to (un)load Ruby scripts

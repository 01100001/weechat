    WeeChat 0.2.1 released.

* FlashCode, 2006-08-19

    WeeChat 0.2.0 released.

    Important release notes:

    - if you upgraded with /upgrade in WeeChat, you should /disconnect and
      then /reconnect on each server, to display properly channel/user modes
    - if you're using plugins, you should remove some old plugins libraries
      in WeeChat system library directory (commonly
      /usr/local/lib/weechat/plugins): remove lib* files (like libperl.*,
      libpython.*, ..) and keep only new libraries (perl.*, python.*, ..)

    WeeChat 0.1.9 released.

    Important release notes:

    - please close all DCC chat buffers before using /upgrade command,
      otherwise you may experience problems with DCC chats.
    - some changes in script API: now timer handlers functions takes exactly
      0 (zero) argument (in version 0.1.8, two arguments were mandatory but
      not used: server and args)

* FlashCode, 2006-03-18

    WeeChat 0.1.8 released.

    Important release notes:

    - it is recommended for users of version 0.1.7 (or any older), to
      replace values in setup file (~/.weechat/weechat.rc) :
        - option: log_path: replace "~/.weechat/logs" by "%h/logs"
        - option: plugins_path: replace "~/.weechat/plugins" by "%h/plugins"
      "%h" is replaced by WeeChat home (default: ~/.weechat, may be overriden
      by new command line arg --dir)
    - after installing 0.1.8 (or with /upgrade), issue both commands (if you
      didn't redefined these keys (alt-home/end):
      /key unbind meta-meta2-1~
      /key unbind meta-meta2-4~
      then launch again WeeChat (or issue /upgrade).
      Alt-home/end were used for nicklist scroll, they're now replaced by
      Alt-F11/F12.

    WeeChat 0.1.7 released.

    Important release notes:

    - Ruby script plugin has been added but is experimental in this release.
      You're warned!

    - "/away" command was changed to be RFC 2812 compliant.
      Now argument is required to set away, and no argument means
      remove away ("back"). Setting "irc_default_msg_away" has been removed.

    WeeChat 0.1.6 released.

    Important release notes:

    - incompatibility with some old scripts: now all handlers have to return
      a code for completion, and to do some actions about message to ignore
      (please look at documentation for detail)

    - on OpenBSD, the new option "plugins_extension" should be set to ".so.0.0"
      since the plugins names are ending by ".so.0.0" and not ".so"

    - with new and full UTF-8 support, the option "look_charset_internal"
      should be set to blank for most cases. Forces it only if your locale is
      not properly detected by WeeChat (you can set "UTF-8" or "ISO-8859-15"
      for example, depending on your locale). WeeChat is looking for "UTF-8" in
      your locale name at startup.

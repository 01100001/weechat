WeeChat - Installation instructions
===================================

You can build WeeChat with cmake (recommended way) or autotools.

- with cmake:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DPREFIX=/where/you/want/install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    make
    make install     (as root for installation in system directories)

- with autotools:

    ./autogen.sh     (for cloned git repository only, not devel package)
    ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/install
    make
    make install     (as root for installation in system directories)


If you want to report bugs/crashs to developers, please:
- compile with debug info (built type Debug for cmake, default for autotools),
- enable core files (for bash shell, add "ulimit -c unlimited" to your ~/.bashrc).


See AUTHORS for support, feel free to contact us for any problem.

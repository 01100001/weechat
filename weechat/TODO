    - "/ignore" and "/unignore" commands: hide all that is write by a given
      nick/host
    - when we're away, WeeChat should log all the lines begenning by our nick.
      When we come back from our away it should print it to the current window

      channels/privates

      in the text bar it send it to the server as "you")
    - "/exec" command: execute a command as if we was in shell
      and show us the output on the current window. An option to exec
      like -o could send the output to the server, on the current
      channel/private
    - "/last": command to look for text in previous messages

 * Interface:
    - color for nicks (except own nick) when nick colors are disabled
    - interpret special chars in messages (color & bold for example)

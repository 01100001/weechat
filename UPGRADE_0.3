WeeChat Upgrade to 0.3.x
========================
FlashCode <flashcode@flashtux.org>
v0.3.0, 2009-08-09


This document lists major changes introduced in version 0.3.0 and not compatible
with versions 0.2.x.


Upgrade to version 0.3.x
------------------------

It is *NOT POSSIBLE* to use command `/upgrade` from a version 0.2.x to 0.3.x.
You have to quit your old WeeChat, then run new version.

Of course, command `/upgrade` is working fine once you'll be with 0.3.x to
upgrade to another 0.3.x (unless this command is broken again, please look
at release notes (file 'NEWS') for version you're currently installing).


Configuration files
-------------------

Changes with previous versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New configuration files (`*.conf`) are not compatible with old files (`*.rc`).

Name of options is similar to old versions, but there is now one configuration
file by plugin, and one file for WeeChat core.

There is *no automatic conversion* for your old options to new configuration files,
so you'll have to setup again your IRC servers and all other options.

In WeeChat, option names are now with format: `plugin.section.option` (for
WeeChat core, `plugin` is `weechat`).

Examples:

* WeeChat options: `weechat.xxx.yyy`
* IRC options: `irc.xxx.yyy`

You should read quickstart guide to be familiar with basic commands and syntax
(some commands like `/server` have changed): http://weechat.flashtux.org/doc.php


List of configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Old configuration files:
** weechat.rc
** plugins.rc
* New configuration files are now (with default plugins):
** weechat.conf
** alias.conf
** aspell.conf
** charset.conf
** irc.conf
** jabber.conf
** logger.conf
** plugins.conf
** relay.conf
** xfer.conf


Plugin API
----------

Plugin API has been rewritten and is not compatible with previous versions.
Accordingly, scripts and plugins must have been designed for version 0.3.x to
be loaded into WeeChat.

There is no migration script today to convert old script to new API.
Therefore, if you plan to use old script, you'll have to wait for new version
or you can convert script yourself and send us new version ;)

You can download scripts for new API on plugins page:
http://weechat.flashtux.org/plugins.php

More information about new API is available on wiki:
